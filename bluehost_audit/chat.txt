Okay, so let's talk about technical debt in life in general, um, or in both senses here. So, um, years ago, when I first went on the academic job market, I wanted to get a website. Maybe people would be looking me up, want an easy way to find things. Um, so I made this website, matthewshaffer.com was taken, so matthewshaffer.online, and I wasn't much of a, you know, um, web engineer at the time, so I think what I did is I, uh, I knew I wanted to, you know, have my own domain name. So I went through this service called Bluehost, and then made a WordPress website with them in this particular way. And so, like, the domain name is, I don't know if I own it, like, every single year I don't get a charge for the domain name, so I don't know if I, like, rent it from Bluehost with some uh thing, or it's all completely different, I don't even remember, okay? But the bottom line is, back then I did it because I wasn't technically savvy enough to, like, write it all myself in HTML and figure out how to host, so I used this managed service. But now, here we are entering this AI coding-assisted era, and right now I'm feeling annoyed by the constraints I have with, like, the WordPress interface, WordPress interface for making my website, you know what I mean? As it's displayed and populated when people visit it. So, what I wanna know, I just wanna figure out is, and these days, the AI coding systems, I'm confident that for my purposes, it would be completely frictionless and amazing to just have some local repo of some kind that is, like, the website, you know what I mean? But then, I don't really know how that works with the other stuff, like, syncing back up to it, having it serve somewhere else, you know what I mean? All this technical stuff, I don't know. Where I'm going at is these days, coding systems have solved the technical problem of, like, making the HTML pages and orchestrating them, right? But I don't know, actually, the question of the technical problem of just, like, the domain name, the platform I'm using, et cetera. So, I want a brief pressey on this, and more additionally, I want also a pressey on what would be the extra information and documentation that I could access in a low-effort way that would get more resolution on this question, right? So, I'm, perhaps, you can tell me if I'm wrong, you're the expert, perhaps you're gonna come back to me and say, you know, XYZ, some things I can know and some things I can fill you in on, but I don't know the specific nature of your contract with Bluehost or who exactly you paid for for the domain name, and you can access those files here, which will resolve this, something like that, you know what I mean? if that is the case. So, anyways, I need that end-to-end with that one sort of conditional fork, potentially there, recognizing that I can get you the more information. I need to do some download queries for it to get an actual end-to-end path, recognizing it might not be clear as of right now.

This is a great question, and the good news is that the landscape here is actually much simpler than it probably feels from the inside. Let me break this into the two pieces you're asking for.

## The Lay of the Land

There are really only two separate things you're paying for, even if they feel tangled together: the **domain name** and the **hosting**.

Your domain name (matthewschaefer.online) is essentially a lease — nobody truly "owns" a domain, you renew it annually (or in multi-year chunks) through a **registrar**. Bluehost is both a hosting company *and* a domain registrar, so when you signed up, they almost certainly bundled both together. This is why it feels like one opaque thing. But the domain registration and the hosting are fundamentally separate services that just happen to be provided by the same company right now. You can move either one independently of the other.

The **hosting** is the part where your actual website files live on a server somewhere that responds when someone types your URL into a browser. Right now, Bluehost is running a WordPress installation for you, which is a whole managed software stack — a database, PHP code, themes, plugins, etc. That's the part that feels constraining, and it's also the part that's become unnecessary given your new capabilities with AI-assisted coding.

Here's the key insight: if you want to move to a simple, hand-coded (or AI-coded) site — just HTML, CSS, maybe a little JavaScript — you don't need anything as heavy as WordPress or Bluehost anymore. Modern static site hosting is essentially free and trivially easy. Services like **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, or **Cloudflare Pages** will host a static website for free, and the deployment workflow is exactly what you're imagining: you have a local folder (a git repo) on your machine, you edit it however you want, you push it, and the site updates within seconds. That's the entire process. AI coding tools slot into this perfectly because you're just generating and editing files locally.

The domain name part is also simple to handle separately. You can **transfer** your domain away from Bluehost to a dedicated registrar like **Cloudflare Registrar**, **Namecheap**, or **Google Domains** (now Squarespace Domains). Then you just point that domain at wherever your new site is hosted by updating a couple of DNS records, which sounds intimidating but is literally just filling in two text fields in a web form.

So the end-to-end path, in broad strokes, is: stand up your new site on a free static host, transfer or re-point your domain to it, and then cancel Bluehost. You'd save money, gain full control, and the AI-assisted workflow would be seamless.

## What You Don't Know Yet and Where to Find It

The conditional fork you're anticipating is real, and here's specifically what you need to figure out before you can act on any of this:

**Who is actually the registrar for your domain?** Bluehost probably is, but it's possible they registered it through a third party on your behalf. The definitive way to check is to do a WHOIS lookup — you can go to `whois.lookup.icann.org` and type in `matthewschaefer.online`, and it will tell you the registrar of record. That resolves this question instantly and for free.

**What exactly is your billing arrangement with Bluehost?** You mentioned you're not sure if you get charged annually for the domain versus the hosting versus some bundle. Log into your Bluehost account (bluehost.com → login) and look at the billing or renewal section. You want to see what renewal dates are coming up, what each line item is for, and whether your domain auto-renews separately from your hosting plan. This tells you your timeline — for example, if your hosting renews in a month but your domain isn't up for renewal for another year, you'd want to act before that hosting charge hits, but you have plenty of time on the domain side.

**Is your domain locked?** Most registrars put a "transfer lock" on domains by default. When you're ready to move the domain, you'll need to unlock it and get an authorization code (sometimes called an EPP code) from Bluehost. This is all in their domain management dashboard — you don't need to call anyone.

Once you have those three pieces of information, the path forward becomes fully concrete with no remaining unknowns. You'd know exactly what you're paying, when, to whom, and what steps to take to decouple the domain from the hosting. From there, spinning up a static site on something like GitHub Pages or Netlify with a local repo is genuinely an afternoon project, especially with AI assistance — and pointing your domain at it is about fifteen minutes of DNS configuration after that.
